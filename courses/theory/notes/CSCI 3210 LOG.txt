Day #2
Language Evaluation Criteria
Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wnats the computer to do

it matters not how exactly the developer understands the code, but that he can communicate the code

the 4 pillars of code

	overall simplicity
a manageable set of features and constructs
Minimal feature multiplicity
more than one way to accomplish a particular operation
minimal operator overlading
a single operator symbol has more than one meaning

less ways to complete one task is good
less ways to define a single instruction is good
An bloated instruction package is good
think sql with the structure of select from where -- good example
think of adding in c++ -- bad example

orthogonality 
a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in realtively small number of ways
ex. no pointless datatypes
more orthogonal means less exceptions within the language
fewer exceptions makes the code a lot easier to read
more exceptions is unnecessary complexity and is in turn harder to read
language already struggle with this 

int x;
int *p;
int score[10];
int **p;
int *scores[10];
int y [1][2];

Readability

The presence of adequate facilities for defining data types and data structures in a language is another significant aid to readability.

syntax design

the syntax of form of the elements of a language has a signifcant effect on the readability of programs

variable nomenclature

compound statements
if
...
end if

begin

end

writability is a measure of how easily a language can be used to create programs for a domain

support for abstraction

process abstraction
	the concept of function
	the semantics are not necessary and only the output is necessary
data abstraction
	the concept of the classes
	the management of the data is set from the get go and are managed around that data structure

expressivity
mean the convenience of the language
strength and number of predefined functions

python vs. java
print"hello" vs. System.out.println("hello"); //taking out things such as the class definition which must surround the code

reliability

a program is said to be reliable if it performs to its specification under all conditions.
