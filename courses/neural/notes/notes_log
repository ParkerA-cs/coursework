takes advantage or parallel processing in order to replicate the "thinking" processes of the human brain
parts work together in tandem rather than a more linear and functional program

	data in -> algorithm -> data out

this is the more normal type of programming

	data in -> untrained algorithm -> data out(often bad)
	with time VVVVVVVVV
	data in -> trained algorithm -> data out much more algorithm

Neural Nets are for problems that are difficult to code by hand

nodes ~~ neurons
Main system behaviour is often learned rather than program

born -> move limbs -> flip over -> crawl -> sit -> walk -> walk faster

learning is the optimization of a task based on a given set of tools and times
also occurs while task is being experienced real life or not
useful is what makes the task as optimal as possible

important in predicting credit card fraud

base concept an algorithm that codes itself based off of exceptions

benefits of knowning CS history
	History prevents redundant repetition
	pioneers help to serve as guide stones
	lol cool

primitive Computer Scientists have always seen parallels between computers and people
	pros/cons to brains vs. computers

neurals nets just closer to human thought than other studies of artificial intelligence

trinity supercomputer los alamos nat lab vs house fly
super computer is faster
	operations
	transforspeeds
housefly is more efficient
	less neurons
	less tdp

what makes neurons special
	slow low bandwidth and imprecise
		no exception handling allows for sensory problems that exist

	cell death, but natural degradation

	always working in parallel with itself

	learning via synapse modding

	connection pathways topologically structured

	there is a spatial orientation to neuron placement

neuron computation
	the speed of a neuron is slow only 100 pulse per second

	think like recognizing someone 
	near instaneaneous therefore what is the algorithm that determines that
	less than 100 steps if one neuron
	multiple neurons work in tandem
	maybe millions

neurons can implement the moment it is made available

brains kind of equal computers
