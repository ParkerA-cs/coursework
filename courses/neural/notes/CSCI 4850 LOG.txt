takes advantage or parallel processing in order to replicate the "thinking" processes of the human brain
parts work together in tandem rather than a more linear and functional program

	data in -> algorithm -> data out

this is the more normal type of programming

	data in -> untrained algorithm -> data out(often bad)
	with time VVVVVVVVV
	data in -> trained algorithm -> data out much more algorithm

Neural Nets are for problems that are difficult to code by hand

nodes ~~ neurons
Main system behaviour is often learned rather than program

born -> move limbs -> flip over -> crawl -> sit -> walk -> walk faster

learning is the optimization of a task based on a given set of tools and times
also occurs while task is being experienced real life or not
useful is what makes the task as optimal as possible

important in predicting credit card fraud

base concept an algorithm that codes itself based off of exceptions
