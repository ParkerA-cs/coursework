turnin code:  cs_p3


Write a C/C++ program that uses pthreads to compute the number of values that are 
evenly divisible by 97 between a specified range of values (INCLUSIVE).

The program should accept 3 command-line arguments:
    low value
    high value
    number of threads to create to perform the computation

--------

./p3  0  9000000000  2   ## sample run:  0 to 9 Billion (INCLUSIVE);  2 threads

alarm(90);    // <---  **** make this the first executable line of your program

cc -Ofast -o p3 p3.c -lm -lpthread    ## have the makefile build your pgm this way

long int      // use long ints in place of normal ints at all places in the code

hard-code the use of 97 in computations, instead of into a variable (const may be ok)

time1    // copy this function from the timedemo.c file to get the time

sample output from the above run:
    THREAD 0: 46391753
    THREAD 1: 46391753
    TOTAL 92783506
    TIME 7.425558

--------

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p3.tar ./p3dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    Your makefile should build an executable named p3
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in a script
    in p3testfiles/PREP.py which must execute correctly to be graded further.
