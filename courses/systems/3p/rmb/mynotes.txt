processes light weight vs heavt weight

light weight processes are threads but can also be called over things

heavy weight processes are referred to as processes

p3 will mainly focus on lightweight processes // main focus on threading

heavy weight processes are tied to an address base where should it created another heavy weight process, then the address base would be copied

because they are tied to address bases in memory and not stored through the registers, then it becomes a harder thing to run some might say heavier

light weight processes also have an address base with instructions, but should it a new thread be created, they will have to be shared

a new address base will not be created

swapped in and out

what our code will need in terms of topics:

we do include the endpoint
utilise 4 threads
to split the work in 2
use the function in time demo in order to get time stamps for the function
put alarm in your code to verify that your account does not get knocked off system64

look at the thread demos
