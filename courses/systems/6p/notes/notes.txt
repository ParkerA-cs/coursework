our program is going to do the following.

we are first going to check for -hw
following this we will then fork a new process
	the child process will run 'nm' on libs func
	it will return information on the shared library and return functions that are present in the library
	
in the parent process we will call those functions that have been linked
we will print the name of the function as well as the output 
AND
if the output = 42 we then star it as well, else, we print out as normale

then it donezo
