turnin code:  cs_p5


BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE LINE IN YOUR PROGRAM:

    alarm(90);


Write a program that loops doing:

    sleep(1);


On receiving SIGINT, the program should print the following message
and continue to execute:

    received SIGINT

On receiving SIGUSR1, the program should print the following message
and continue to execute:

    received SIGUSR1

However, when the program has received a total of 4 SIGUSR1 signals,
it should terminate after printing this message:

    terminating due to 4 SIGUSR1 signals

On receiving SIGUSR2 (2 instead of 1), the program should print the
following message and terminate immediately:

    received SIGUSR2


As in prior projects, if the program is run with a single command-line arg
of  -hw  then it should simply  print hello world   and then  exit(0)


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p5dir:
	tar cvf p5.tar ./p5dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p5
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p5 as described above.
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in the script
    p5testfiles/PREP.py which must execute correctly to be graded further.
