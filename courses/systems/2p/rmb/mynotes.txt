so here what i think the general outline of the code will be. 
overarching the whole program, will be the following items:

the base region and a data structure both of which will be global as they will always need to be accessed

following this, here is what I believe will be the general function of each

heap_init will do the following - 
DONE I THINK SINCE ITS NOT SUPER COMPLEX

heap_alloc will do the foll0wing -
first condition, if the whole structure is empty, we will allocate to the first position
secondly we will do the following,
while loop that processes the whole data structure to find an open enough space for the byte allocation
	at each

heap-free will do the following - 
it will take the information the pointer to area to free and do the following,
1. first it will iterate through every byte address in that allocated section, and null each address.
2. afterwards the function will delete the address region from num_bytes
3. lastly the array will be reordered so that the there are no gaps present within num_bytes
