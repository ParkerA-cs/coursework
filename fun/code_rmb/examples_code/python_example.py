#explain what is happening in this code ?

#brief explanation of what is happening here.
#a = 4 is doing the following
#in python a variable can be simply written in this fashion
#var = some_dat
#in this case any variable can be assigned any type of data
#as the python interpreter will handle it regardless
#and because the python interpreter will handle it as such
#essentially and literally
#the address tied to the alias
#a is being assigned the integer 4.

#print(a) is doing the following
#the python print function is a complete print statement
#that immediately casts all information as a char_arr or string
#then sends it to stdout to be handled in console
#its important to know that in this case we are printing out an int
#essentially and literally
#the 'a' int variable is being cast as a String
#and sent to stdout and appended with a newline
