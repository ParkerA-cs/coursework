the levels notes file will essentially be used to
entertain the creations of questions at levels of all
CS students, having a basic idea of the curriculum
of CS and IS students, what is really helpful is being
able to prepare students early on to write and understand
the code that they are writing. the problem with this is that
the questions are often geared towards students who have made it out of
courses such as Discrete Structures and Algorithms and Data Structures.
Knowing this, it will be onto us to not only create realistic questions.
but also attainable questions, should the student be not as far along
in the program.
